### The OSI Model 

OSI Model has seven hierarchical layers that were developed to enable different networks to communicate reliably between disparate systems.
The OSI was created by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to break the barrier of communication between disparate systems.
The OSI model is the primary architectural model for networks

It describes how data and network information are communicated from an application on one computer through the network media to an application on another computer. It is a conceptual blueprint of how communications should take place. It addresses all the processes required for effective communication and divides these processes into logical groupings called layers. When a communication system is designed in this manner, it’s known as ‘layered architecture’.


#### Advantages of OSI Model				
The OSI model divides network communication processes into smaller and simpler components, thus aiding component development, design, and troubleshooting.
 It allows multiple-vendor development through the standardization of network components.
It encourages industry standardization by defining the specific functions that occur at each layer of the model.
It allows various types of network hardware and software to communicate.
It prevents changes in one layer from affecting other layers, facilitating development and making application programming much easier.
